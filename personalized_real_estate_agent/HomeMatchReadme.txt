In this project, I developed an application named "HomeMatch". The application leverages large language models (LLMs) and vector databases to transform standard real estate listings into personalized narratives that resonate with potential buyers' unique preferences.

First, we leverage an LLM to generate some real estate listings. We then store those listings in a vector database. Next, we create a survey of user preferences, and query the vector database to find the relevant listings based on user preferences. Last, for those relevant listings, we augment the descriptions using an LLM to align them with the buyer's preferences. 

To run the code, install the libraries listed in the requirements.txt, open the jupyter notebook and run the cells.
